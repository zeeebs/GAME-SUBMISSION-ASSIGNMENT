# Unreal-Engine-First-Person-Shooter-Game

This repository is for the First-Person Shooter game that I made using C++ and Unreal Engine.

<p><a href="https://github.com/zeeebs/Unreal-Engine-First-Person-Shooter-Game/tree/main"_blank">First-Person Shooter Game</a>
    <p>This is a simple Unreal Engine game that uses a first-person character with the goal of destroying all the blocks in the environment. Blueprints were used to provide a counter and counter HUD, as well as a win screen when the goal is achieved. Upon collision between the projectile and the box, the box is destroyed, and the counter changes. You can see it <a href="https://github.com/zeeebs/TTA-C-PlusPlus-And-UnrealEngine-Projects/tree/main/MyProject"_blank">here</a> as well.
